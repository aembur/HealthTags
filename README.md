Simple 1.12.2 Forge mod that shows health above players' names, similar to LabyMod's DamageIndicators. I didn't find any Forge alternatives to that, so I made this.

## Installation
1. Install the latest [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) for 1.12.2
2. Get the latest version of HealthTags from the [releases](https://github.com/aembur/HealthTags/releases) page
3. Put the file in your `.minecraft/mods` folder
